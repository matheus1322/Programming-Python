1.Write a program that reads an integer and prints whether it is a positive, negative or zero. 

Num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) 

if Num > 0:  

   print("The number is positive.") 

elif Num < 0:  

   print("The number is negative.")  

else:  

   print("The number is zero.") 

 

 2 Write a program reads an integer and prints how many digits the number has, by checking whether the number is >= 10 , >=100,..etc, assuming all intergers are less than 10 billion, if the number is negative then first multiply by -1.  

 

Num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  

Num = abs(Num) 

Dig_count = 1 

Limit = 10   

 while Num >= limit and limit <= 10000000000: 

    Dig_count += 1 

    Limit *= 10  

  

print(f"The number has {dig_count} digits.") 

 

 

3 Write a program that read three numbers and print “in order” if they are sorted in ascending or descending order, or “not in order” otherwise.  

 

Num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))   

 Num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))   

 Num3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))  

  

 if Num1 <= Num2 <= Num3: 

    print("In order (ascending)")   

 elif Num1 >= Num2 >= Num3: 

    print("In order (descending)")   

 else: 

    print("Not in order") 

 

 

 

4 Write a program that reads in a string and prints whether it: 

Contains only letters 

Contains only uppercase 

Contains only lowercase 

Contains only digits 

Contins letters and digits 

Starts with uppercase 

Ends with full stop.  

 

Text = input("Enter a string: ") 

  

if Text.isalpha(): 

   print("Contains only letters") 

if Text.isupper(): 

    print("Contains only uppercase") 

if Text.islower(): 

    print("Contains only lowercase") 

if Text.isdigit(): 

    print("Contains only digits") 

if any(c.isalpha() for c in Text) and any(c.isdigit() for c in Text): 

    print("Contains letters and digits") 

if Text[0].isupper(): 

    print("Starts with uppercase") 

if Text.endswith("."): 

    print("Ends with full stop") 

 

5 Write a program that asks the user to enter the a month (1 for January, 2 for February,..) and then prints the number of days in the month. For February, print 28 or 29 days 

 

Month = int(input("Enter a month (one number between 1 and 12): "))  

Days_in_month = { 1: 31, 2: "28 or 29", 3: 31, 4: 30, 5: 31, 6: 30, 7: 31, 8: 31, 9: 30, 10: 31, 11: 30, 12: 31 }  

if Month in Days_in_month:  

   print(f"The month has {Days_in_month[Month]} days.")  

else:  

   print("Invalid month. Please enter a number between 1 and 12.")
